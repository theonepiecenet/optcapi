        "captainNotes": "[SEMLA] orbs replace [RCV] orbs and heal at the end of the enemy turn and can not be swapped by special abilities. In order to Power Up Big Mom, you must eat a [SEMLA] orb and will be powered up the following turn. While in Rampage, Big Mom will always attack a random enemy on her own, even while Binded or Paralyzed, and hit a HUNGRY, which deals the same damage as a PERFECT. This attack occurs after your chain, so Big Mom's attack will not be affected by Chain Limiters, Chain Boosters, or Chain Lockers (still untested with 2 Big Mom captains). You can not activate Big Mom's special while in Rampage. To exit Rampage, you must consume a [SEMLA] orb."
