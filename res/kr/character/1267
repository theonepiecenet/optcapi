    "captain": "Boosts ATK of all characters by 2.75x and their HP by 1.5x if you have a Striker, Shooter, Fighter, and Slasher on your crew. Attacks will ignore defensive barriers and buffs.",
    "captainNotes": "Attacks are still affected by DEF value. DEF boost buffs (Blue shield) still reduce your damage, but Damage Negating (Yellow shield) and % Damage Reduction (Rainbow shield) are ignored). Multiple class characters count as a character of each class. Enemy attacks will go through YOUR defensive buffs.",
    "special": "Cuts the current HP of each enemy by 30%. If Blackbeard is a captain, this ability will ignore damage negating abilities and barriers",
    "specialNotes": "If Blackbeard is not a captain, the effect works exactly like Whitebeard special and is affected by barriers.",
