    "captainNotes": "In order to increase Gear Power Gauge level, you must hit a PERFECT with Luffy or consume [RCV] orbs. MAX Gear Power Gauge level is 8.

While in Gear 4, Luffy will stay in that form until Gauge Power goes to 0. Attacking with any character while in Gear 4 reduces Gear Power Gauge by 3.",
