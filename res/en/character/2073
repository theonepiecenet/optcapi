If Gear Power is above 50%, change between Gear 2 and Gear 3. If Gear Power is full, change into Gear 4 - Boundman. This can be used an unlimited amount of times per turn.",
    "captainNotes": "In order to increase Gear Power Gauge level, you must hit a PERFECT with Luffy or consume [RCV] orbs. MAX Gear Power Gauge level is 8. Hitting a PERFECT with Luffy and consuming a [RCV] orb increases Gauge level by 1. If Luffy gets swapped out in battle, Gear Gauge Power will go to 0. While in Gear 4, Luffy will stay in that form until Gauge Power goes to 0. Attacking with any character while in Gear 4 reduces Gear Power Gauge by 3.",
