    "captain": "Boosts ATK of all characters by 2.75x and their HP by 1.5x if you have a Striker, Shooter, Fighter and Slasher on your crew. Attacks will ignore defensive barriers and buffs.",
    "captainNotes": "Attacks are still affected by DEF value. DEF boost buffs (Blue shield) still reduce your damage, but Damage Negating (Yellow shield) and % Damage Reduction (Rainbow shield) are ignored). Multiple class characters count as a character of each class. Enemy attacks will go through YOUR defensive buffs.",
